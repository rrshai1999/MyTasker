About MyTasker™
---------------
MyTasker is a web-based solution to help with managing complex tasks and subsequent to-do lists
arising from these tasks. The difference is that it’s only for one, not just for anyone. In other words,
your way is the only way and everything else is “wrong”. A task may seem insurmountable and
daunting when we do not break it down into smaller manageable tasks; the average number of
items a person has in working memory is between three and five items, with a tendency to think
“What do I do next?” and consequently go off track. (Cowan, 2010)
Therefore, the approach I propose to break down a task applied in MyTasker is to use five key
components (5KP). These components are:

  •&emsp;Task title, the name of the task to complete.

  •&emsp;Task priority, a measure of the urgency to complete this task.

  •&emsp;Task date, the due date for this task to be completed.

  •&emsp;Task description, a detailed description of what the task is for and the necessity of this task.

  •&emsp;Optional Sub-task list for a step-by-step checklist of task completion.
  
By breaking down a task into these sub-components, a person will have specific goals which require
a specific amount of effort. This will give a person motivation to complete the goal, putting aside
anything irrelevant, as well as persistence to attain success in finishing the task. Furthermore, there
is measurable progress to be seen completing each task.
